Blockwise excursion sampling (BES) is a de novo computational protocol
to build heterogeneous structural ensembles for intrinsically disordered
proteins (IDPs). This method combines the strength of the simulated
annealing with short molecular dynamics simulations to quickly explore
local regions of the conformational space.

BES protocol needs a software for molecular dynamics simulations. Here,
tcl scripts of BES protocol was implemented for NAMD.

This directory includes the following folder and files:

Example---> an example of BES for Amyloid beta
base.conf---> contains basic config options for NAMD
EC.conf---> tcl script of BES algorithm
EC_Parameter---> a config file for EC.tcl script


This Algorithm is described in the following publication:
N Salehi, M Amininasab, R Firouzi, MH Karimi-Jafaria,Efficient construction of
a diverse conformational library for amyloid-Î² as an intrinsically disordered 
protein. Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling, 2019, 88, 183-193.
